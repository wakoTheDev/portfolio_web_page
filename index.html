                    <h4>Genre Classifier Model</h4>

The Genre Classifier Model is a machine learning system designed to automatically categorize songs into different genres based on their audio features.

<h5>Key Features:</h5>

Feature Extraction: The model extracts relevant audio features from songs, such as tempo, rhythm, melody, and spectral characteristics.
Training: Using a labeled dataset of songs with predefined genres, the model is trained to recognize patterns and correlations between audio features and genres.
Classification: Once trained, the model can analyze new, unlabeled songs and predict their genre based on the learned patterns.
Evaluation: The model's accuracy and performance are evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable classification.
This genre classification system enhances music organization, recommendation systems, and playlist generation by automating the process of genre identification. <br/>
